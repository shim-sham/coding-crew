  <h1 ><br>hi there :)</h1>
  <p>if you've noticed the lack of communities for programmers in leicester, you're not the only one! after a quick google search, we coders quickly realise that the only way for us to connect is globally and online. <br> there are very few options for us to meet up and collaborate in-person, and i'm sure we're all fustrated about this; we're all looking for a space to share ideas, work on projects together, or simply meet like-minded people! <br><br></p> 
  <h1 class = "headline">so let's create what we're all dreaming for.</h1>
  <p> join our 'coding crew', a found family of people of all skill levels in coding! we'll meet up regularly in public places in leicester, share feedback on projects, and maybe even organise hackathons! </p>

  <p><a href="#sign-up-form">sign up!</a> i'll get back to you within 24 hours. join our local coding crew :) <br>~ shambhavi, a student in leicester who loves coding!<br><br><br></p>
